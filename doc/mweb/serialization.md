## Transaction Format Changes

A new transaction "flag" value of `0x08` was added to indicate that a transaction has MWEB data attached to it. The MWEB data is serialized after any script witnesses and before `lock_time`. The new 'extended' transaction format is as follows:

| Field Size | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | version | int32_t | Transaction data format version |
| 1 | marker | char | Must be zero |
| 1 | flag | char | Bitmask with bit 1 indicating the existence of script witnesses, and bit 8 indicating the existence of MWEB data |
| 1+ | txin_count | compact_size | Number of transaction inputs |
| 0+ | txins | txin[] | A list of zero or more transaction inputs |
| 1+ | txout_count | compact_size | Number of transaction outputs |
| 0+ | txouts | txouts[] | A list of zero or more transaction outputs |
| 1+ if (flag & 0x01) | script_witnesses | script_witnesses[] | The witness structure as a serialized byte array |
| 1 if (flag & 0x08) | mweb_tx_present | uint8_t | Presence marker for MWEB transaction info. `0x00` = no attached mweb_tx (HogEx encoding), `0x01` = mweb_tx serialized next |
| 1+ if (mweb_tx_present == 0x01) | mweb_tx | mweb_tx | The serialized MWEB transaction data. Exists for mempool txs only. Txs in a block already have MWEB data stripped. |
| 4 | lock_time | uint32_t | The block number or timestamp until which the transaction is locked |

Notes:
* `mweb_tx_present` is serialized using an optional-pointer marker and should be encoded as either `0x00` or `0x01`.
* Current parser behavior is permissive: only `0x01` is treated as "present"; any other value is treated as "absent".
* Unknown optional transaction flag bits are rejected.
* If witness data is encoded (`flag & 0x01`), at least one input witness stack must be non-empty.
* If MWEB flag is set with `mweb_tx_present == 0x00` (HogEx encoding), `txouts` must be non-empty.

#### mweb_tx

| Field Size | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | kernel_offset | BlindingFactor | A 32-byte secret scalar |
| 32 | stealth_offset | BlindingFactor | A 32-byte secret scalar |
| 101+ | body | mweb_tx_body | The MWEB inputs, outputs, and kernels. Must contain at least 1 kernel. |

## Block Format Changes

If the last transaction in a block is marked as the HogEx transaction, then immediately following the last transaction in the block will be a single-byte marker indicating whether an `mweb_block` is included. If that marker is `0x01`, an `mweb_block` follows.

| Field Size | Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | header | CBlockHeader | The block header |
| 1+ | vtx | CTransaction[] | The block's transactions |
| 1 if last transaction is HogEx | has_mweb | uint8_t | Presence marker. `0x00` = no extension block serialized, `0x01` = extension block serialized next |
| 166+ if has_mweb == 1 | mweb_block | mweb_block | The MWEB block data |

Note:
* `has_mweb` is serialized using an optional-pointer marker and should be encoded as either `0x00` or `0x01`.
* Current parser behavior is permissive: only `0x01` is treated as "present"; any other value is treated as "absent".
