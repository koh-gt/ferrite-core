## Telegram - [View Group](https://t.me/ferrite_core) 

## Features:
### 1 minute block time - 
Transactions are received instantly and can be confirmed within minutes.

### 1 hour difficulty adjustment time - 
Difficulty adjusts in 60 blocks, allowing for dynamic difficulty adaptation.
If mining hashrate spikes, difficulty will quickly rise to limit supply.
If mining hashrate plummets, difficulty will quickly drop to encourage mining.

### Limited supply - 
A maximum of 100 FEC (Ferrite coins) are mined in a block. 
This number will halve every 301107 blocks, or about 8 months considering block propagation time.
There will be no more than 60,221,400 FEC. 1e+16 times smaller than Avogadro's number!

### Transparency - 
No pre-mine - Linux Executables are uploaded on public Telegram and Discord groups as early as block 120 (2 hours), with full migration to Github by block 3000 (50 hours).

### Decentralised - 
Ferrite has no owner. The miners shall decide the fate of the network.

### Pseudonymous -
Nobody knows who owns the mined coins, nor who sent the coins. Unless you identify as the owner of the public address, you maintain anonymity.

### Scrypt Algorithm -  
Reuse obsolete Litecoin and Dogecoin miners to mine Ferrite. Originally designed to be ASIC resistant.

Why the name Ferrite Core? - The humble ferrite core is cheap and hidden from view. Most people have never heard about it, yet it is what allows our electric generators, switches and radio antennas to function. It has high magnetic permeability allowing for magnetic fields to pass through, yet has low electrical conductivity which reduces eddy current losses. Most importantly, the ferrite core possesses these properties while being cheap and safe to use. This makes the ferrite core suitable for being used as magnetic cores for electromagnet coils. 
Similarly, I hope that Ferrite Core will be used for fast, low volume transactions as well as small amount remittances for the unbanked people in developing nations to avoid exuberant remittance costs. A low price will ensure that Ferrite coins and its fees stay affordable.  
The Ferrite coin logo is the IEEE-315 circuit diagram symbol for a ferrite bead.

There are so many coins out there, what makes this special? - Nothing. This coin is created for a social experiment and not for profit. Ultimately, Ferrite is just copied code, pre-generated code, and lines of edited code. Ferrite coins, like other cryptocurrencies, have zero intrinsic value.

High adoption rates need not be expensive, and high market cap is not the way to having high adoption.
How many people are in cryptocurrency for its technological features rather than its profit potential?

### Graphs
This coin would either be very active or completely inactive in a year or two. For the sake of practicality the graphs will not extend beyond the time scope of 750 days. This should be enough to capture the first 3 halvings.
